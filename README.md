## How to Run

You can make sure you have the latest version of the database by running:

```shell
docker-compose pull
```

Then run it with docker-compose:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Make API requests by using the root address:
`http://localhost:3000/api/`

You should get a response with the available endpoints for the root:

```json
{
  "ability-scores": "/api/ability-scores",
  "classes": "/api/classes",
  "conditions": "/api/conditions",
  "damage-types": "/api/damage-types",
  "equipment-categories": "/api/equipment-categories",
  "equipment": "/api/equipment",
  "features": "/api/features",
  "languages": "/api/languages",
  "magic-schools": "/api/magic-schools",
  "monsters": "/api/monsters",
  "proficiencies": "/api/proficiencies",
  "races": "/api/races",
  "skills": "/api/skills",
  "spells": "/api/spells",
  "starting-equipment": "/api/starting-equipment",
  "subclasses": "/api/subclasses",
  "subraces": "/api/subraces",
